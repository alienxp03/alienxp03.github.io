      <description>In Fave, we are still largely powered by our majestic monolith Ruby on Rails app. On 3rd November 2021, we finally reached a big milestone and upgraded our app from 4.2 to 5.0!
Initially, we wanted to upgrade earlier. However priority changed. Truth is, it took us around 3 years and 3 months before we finally finished the upgrade. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to share on our Rails upgrade journey and why it took us so long to reach here.</description>
